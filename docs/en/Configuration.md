Configuration
================================

A number of options are configurable in the forum module. Most are in the CMS and can be customized on a per forum holder basis
which are configurable from the forum holder page.

An example of options which are configurable in the CMS include 

* Show In Categories - Group multiple forums into a 'category'. Eg Modules might be a category and Ecommerce, Forum would be forums in that category
* Display Signatures - Allow people to attach signatures to their posts
* Forbidden Words - List of words which will be removed from posts
* Viewers - set who can view this forum 
* Posters - set who can post to this forum
* To enable a user to be able to subscribe to a forum so that they can receive emails when a new post is sent out, log into the CMS, click on your
forum holder page and choose the settings tab. Check the field "Allow users to subscribe to forums" and choose an email address that this should come from
note - that this only controls the Forum subscription and not the topic subscription.
* From Email - sets the reply address for the forum when an email is sent
